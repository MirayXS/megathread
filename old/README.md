## How to translate:

Any translations are welcome, we don't really expect much from a PR right now, but please keep these
in mind before you begin:

- Try to keep it decent, we don't want _actual_ native speakers to be confused with half-baked
  translations, so atleast have basic knowledge of said language. Also, you are not allowed to use
  translators like Google Translate.

- You are not allowed to add your own stuff in, nor allowed to upload files or modify the format, it
  has to be the exact format.

Finally, when you are done, you can fork the repo, rename README.md to README\_(language-name-here,
example: README_ES.md).md and edit the contents, PR it with the Translations label and we will take
a look when we get time, thanks again!
